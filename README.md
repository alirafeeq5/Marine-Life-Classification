# Marine-Life-Classification
The goal of this project is to develop and train a deep learning model to classify images of marine animals into one of five classes: fish, jelly, shark, tuna, or whale. The dataset is organized into separate subsets for training and validation.

The specific task for this project is to develop a deep learning classification model to accurately predict the class of marine animal images based on the provided dataset. The model will be trained using the images in the train subset and evaluated on the images in the val subset.

Instructions

To run the classification task:

1.	Data Preparation:

    •	Ensure that the dataset is properly downloaded and organized as described above.

3.	Model Training:
   
    •	Use your preferred deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train a classification model on the train subset.

5.	Model Evaluation:

    •	Evaluate the trained model's performance on the val subset to measure classification accuracy.
